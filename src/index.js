// Imported solution function from lib.js
import { reverse } from './lib.js'

// Example test cases (copied from codewars)
let testOne = reverse("Reverse this string, please!")
let testTwo = reverse("I really don't like reversing strings!")

// Test results logged console:
console.log(testOne === "Reverse siht string, !esaelp")
console.log(testTwo === "I yllaer don't ekil reversing !sgnirts")

// Note that these were the only test cases I was able to copy
// down. Rest assured, this solution still passes the 44 other 
// test cases on codewars that I couldn't get down.
