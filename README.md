# CodeWars Presentation Assignment

---

For this assignment, students are to work fundamental JavaScript problems on Code Wars. Each will select one of the problems they worked and prepare a short presentation for the following morning discussing the problem and their solution. Each individual's honor earned on Code Wars before the presentations will be counted towards their teams points.

## Goal

---

To have students practice the basics of the JavaScript language through practice problems, expose them to the babel build tool and mocha and chai unit testing softwares, and to allow them to practice their presentation skills.

## Tasks

---

- [ ] (OPTIONAL) Do the steps below using test driven development, develop your test cases first and write your solution function based on those (this could help you to solve the problem on codewars)
- [ ] Select a problem from codewars which you have completed
- [ ] Add a src folder and copy and paste your solution code into a new file called ```lib.js``` (this should be a single function)
- [ ] Also, copy and paste the problem description in a comment block above your solution in ```lib.js```
- [ ] Export your function from ```lib.js``` and import it into ```test.js```
- [ ] In ```test.js``` import ```chai``` and use the expect/should assertion library (http://chaijs.com/api/bdd/)
- [ ] Using ```mocha``` and ```chai``` write a few test cases for your function
- [ ] Prepare a short (5 min. max) presentation in which you'll explain the problem and describe you approached the problem and your solution (If you solved it using test driven development, run through your test creation steps)
