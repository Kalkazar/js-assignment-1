# CodeWars Presentation Assignment

---

For this assignment, students are to work fundamental JavaScript problems on Code Wars. Each will select one of the
problems they worked and prepare a short presentation for the following morning discussing the problem and their
solution. Each individual's honor earned on Code Wars before the presentations will be counted towards their teams
points.

## Goal

---

To have students practice the basics of the JavaScript language through practice problems, expose them to the babel
build tool and give them an opportunity to practice communicating effectively about their code
